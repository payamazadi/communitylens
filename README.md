# CommunityLens
CommmunityLens intends to aggregate public data at the census tract level to present a view of life in each community.
Public data includes crime, income, unemployment, welfare, education, and more.

To start to see a vision for this, open the montgomery_county_income_map.html file which is generated by the associated .ipynb file (Jupyter Lab Notebook).

The bulk of effort so far has been on crime data. Start by reading the Crime Report MS-Word doc.

To play with the data yourself, setup the Postgres NIBRS database, according to this:
1. Install Postgres. I used the Mac installer from their homepage but you can also use brew.
2. You have to update the NIBRS_VICTIM csv (w a plain text editor). Fin/replace NS with -1, NN with -2, NB with -3, BB with -4
3. Create the database: 
```
psql -U postgres & create database nibrs_2021;
```
4. Setup the tables: 
```
psql -U postgres -d nibrs_2021 -f postgres_setup.sql
```
5. Populate the tables 
```
psql -U postgres -d nibrs_2021 -f postgres_load.sql
```
6. Run all the queries in analysis/views.sql, and then run the queries in clearances.sql, which is the analysis done so far, focused on clearance rates by offense by county.
